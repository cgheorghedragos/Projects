                                The full definition of the prosumer can be found in GEO 143 of 28.12.2021. In short, to
                                be a prosumer you must:

                                    (production for own consumption, not for sale).</li>

                                compensation or regularisation mechanisms provided by law?</p>
                            <p>
                            <ol class="s">
                                <li>The main activity of the prosumer is not electricity generation (generation for own

                                <li>The electrical scheme of the photovoltaic power plant is designed in such a way that
                                    both the energy supply of the prosumer from the electricity grid and the delivery of
                                    the energy produced by the photovoltaic power plant to the grid are made through the
                                    same connection.</li>
                                <li>The electricity metering system is realized either with smart meters or with meters
                                    that allow at least remote reading, which can be integrated in smart electricity
                                    metering systems.</li>

                    <h4>The legislative framework - how is regularisation carried out?</h4>

                    <p>
                        Regulation is done differently depending on the installed capacity of the PV plant. For
                        photovoltaic plants with an installed electrical power of 200 kW or less per consumption site,
                        the quantitative compensation mechanism applies, and suppliers are obliged to:
                    <ol class="s">
                        <li>make a quantitative compensation in the bill of the consumers, i.e. to invoice only the
                            difference between the amount of energy consumed and the amount of energy produced;

                            diferenta dintre cantitatea de energie consumata si cantitatea de energie produsa;</li>
                        <li>carry forward in the bills of consumers, in the case where the amount of energy produced is
                            greater than the amount of energy consumed, the difference between the amount of active
                            energy delivered and that consumed, consumers having the possibility to consume the amount
                            of active energy carried forward for a maximum period of 24 months from the date of
                            invoicing.

                        </li>

                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For photovoltaic power plants with an installed electrical power of more than 200 kW, but no
                        more than 400 kW per consumption site, the financial regularisation mechanism applies, with
                        suppliers being obliged to:
                    <ol class="s">
                        <li>purchase the energy produced at a price equal to the weighted average price recorded on the
                            Market for the Next Day in the month in which the energy was produced;</li>
                        <li>make in the bill of the consumers the financial regularization between the delivered
                            electricity and the electricity consumed from the grid.

                        </li>
