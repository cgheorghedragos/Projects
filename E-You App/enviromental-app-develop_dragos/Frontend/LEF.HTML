                    <h2>How to have an energy-efficient home?</h2>
                    <h5>7 September 2022</h5>
                    <img src="g.jpg">

                    <p>
                        An energy-efficient home is one that uses as little energy as possible for lighting, heating and
                        cooling. In recent years, building green homes has become an important concern for builders and
                        developers from both environmental and economic perspectives.
                        <br />
                        All over the world, people have become increasingly interested in low energy housing, which is
                        approaching zero energy consumption. There is already a European directive on this subject,
                        which will be enforced on the last day of 2020.This directive concerns the construction of
                        passive houses, which provide thermal comfort with low energy consumption.
                        <br />
                        Passive houses have the highest energy efficiency standard in the world and aim to keep total
                        heat, hot water and electricity consumption below 42 kWh/m² per year. Of course, a passive house
                        with this level of consumption per year is a tough target to reach, but that doesn't mean we
                        can't make our homes more efficient gradually each year until we reach the target.
                        <br />
                        Energy efficiency is not just about insulating your home, but also about having a heating system
                        that relies on renewable energy, and a ventilation system that extracts and filters stale air
                        without losing heat in the process.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Energy-efficient homes have a low energy balance. A home's energy balance is the energy consumed
                        to ensure that the home's inhabitants enjoy high thermal comfort and superior air quality. The
                        geodesic dome is an example of a highly energy-efficient building, and this efficiency is
                        largely due to the shape of the building.
                        <br />

                        Since 2013, owners have been obliged to have an energy certificate for the house at the time of
                        sale, and without it, sale-purchase contracts could be cancelled. Energy certificates are those
                        that classify the house in a certain consumption category - class A, B, C.
                        <br />
                    <h3>How to build an energy efficient house<br /></h3>
                    It's much easier to build an energy-efficient house from scratch than to increase the energy
                    efficiency of a house already built.
                    <br />
                    At the design stage you have full control over the construction and can choose an orientation that
                    will increase the home's energy efficiency, as well as the materials, from the start. Here are the
                    most important steps you need to take to build an energy efficient home:
                    <ol class="s">
                        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Choosing the location for building the house </li>
                        If you have an energy-efficient home in mind, the lot on which it's built and the topography are
                        aspects that can influence long-term costs.
                        <br /><br />
                        A house in the mountains consumes more resources than one on the plains, for example. Wherever
                        possible, choose a sunny location that allows you to build a house with the lowest possible
                        energy consumption.
                        <br /><br />

                        <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Orientation of the house</li>
                        The orientation of the house is an important aspect that homebuyers have been guided by for
                        decades. A north-facing house will be cooler and use more energy, while a south-facing house is
                        more economical.
                        <br /><br />

                        <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Rooms for increased energy efficiency</li>
                        On the south and east sides, bedrooms should be placed, and rooms that don't need much heat
                        should be placed on the north.
                        <br /><br />

                        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Choice of building materials</li>
                        Among the most energy-efficient materials are recycled steel, insulated cement board, structural
                        insulated panels, low-e glazing, vacuum insulation panels.
                        <br /><br />

                        <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Choosing thermal insulation and waterproofing</li>

                        Home insulation is essential when talking about an energy efficient home. When choosing
                        materials for house insulation, criteria such as thermal conductivity (k or λ) and thermal
                        resistance (R-value) are taken into account. Polystyrene and mineral wool are viable options,
                        but you can also go for environmentally friendly options such as polyurethane foam from plant
                        materials, straw bales, even sheep's wool.
                        <br /><br />

                        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Designing and choosing the roof</li>
                        Cool roofs are the most widely used in building energy-efficient homes and reduce energy
                        consumption by up to 10%.
                        <br /><br />

                        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Designing eaves and shading elements</li>
                        Stretches and other adjacent elements should be designed so that energy losses are minimised.
                        <br /><br />

                        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Window design, sizing and selection</li>
                        Windows are where the greatest heat loss occurs so it is preferable to choose 4-season or low-e
                        windows and high quality joinery that does not allow heat loss.

                        <br /><br />
                        <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Choosing an efficient heating/cooling system</li>
                        Heat pumps are among the most economical home heating systems. If heat pump systems cannot be
                        installed, central heating systems, especially condensing ones, or air conditioners in the
                        higher energy classes, can be used.

                        <br /><br />
                        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Using natural elements to increase the energy efficiency of your
                            home</li>
                        Tree barriers, shading pergolas are natural and inexpensive solutions to increase the energy
                        efficiency of a building.
                        <br /><br />

                        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Humidity control and ventilation</li>
                        Ventilation systems that also have a humidity control function help to save the energy used to
                        heat and cool the home, and therefore contribute greatly to increasing the energy efficiency of
                        the home.

                        <br /><br />
                        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Heat recovery ventilation</li>
                        The heat recovery ventilation system is one of the most economical. The principle of operation
                        is very simple: warm air is extracted from the house and its heat is transferred to the cold air
                        taken in from outside, heating it. The system can also be used in summer to cool the house.
                        <br /><br />

                        <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Using alternative energy sources</li>
                        A home powered by solar energy through photovoltaic panels is certainly one of the most
                        economical in the long run, as is the use of electricity produced by wind power systems. Another
                        option, which is also used in Romania, in Beiuș for example, is geothermal water heating.
                        <br />
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Increasing the energy efficiency of a house</h3>
                    <br />
                    If the building is already constructed and the house cannot be designed from the outset to consume
                    as little energy as possible, we can turn to subsequent solutions. Those interested can access funds
                    through the Green House programme, which aims to make homes more efficient. Through this programme,
                    funds can be accessed for insulating the home as well as installing systems that provide electricity
                    from renewable sources.
                    <br />

                    We can reduce the energy consumption of an existing house or apartment by:
                    <ol class="s">
                        <li>Insulating inside walls - with polystyrene, mineral wool or environmentally friendly
                            materials such as straw bales </li>
                        <li>Insulating the outside of walls</li>
                        <li>Changing the windows - because most heat is lost through windows, changing them can greatly
                            improve thermal comfort in the home</li>
                        <li>Insulating the roof, loft or terrace</li>
                        <li>Basement insulation </li>
                        <li>Making the heating/cooling system more efficient</li>
                        <li>Energy efficiency - using energy saving light bulbs, energy savers, energy saving equipment,
                            new energy efficient appliances</li>
                        <li>Heating efficiency of domestic water heating or reducing energy consumption</li>
                        <li>Using intelligent systems to monitor temperature, humidity and other comfort factors -
                            thermostats, for example, are a great help in saving energy
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    Energy efficient buildings are the future for our homes and beyond. Investing in energy-saving
                    solutions will also save money and take care of the environment.

                        It's much easier to build an energy-efficient house from scratch than to increase the energy
                        efficiency of a house already built.
                        <br />
                        At the design stage you have full control over the construction and can choose an orientation
                        that
                        will increase the home's energy efficiency, as well as the materials, from the start. Here are
                        the
                        most important steps you need to take to build an energy efficient home:
                        <ol class="s">
                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Choosing the location for building the house </li>
                            If you have an energy-efficient home in mind, the lot on which it's built and the topography
                            are
                            aspects that can influence long-term costs.
                            <br /><br />
                            A house in the mountains consumes more resources than one on the plains, for example.
                            Wherever
                            possible, choose a sunny location that allows you to build a house with the lowest possible
                            energy consumption.
                            <br /><br />

                            <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Orientation of the house</li>
                            The orientation of the house is an important aspect that homebuyers have been guided by for
                            decades. A north-facing house will be cooler and use more energy, while a south-facing house
                            is
                            more economical.
                            <br /><br />

                            <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Rooms for increased energy efficiency</li>
                            On the south and east sides, bedrooms should be placed, and rooms that don't need much heat
                            should be placed on the north.
                            <br /><br />

                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Choice of building materials</li>
                            Among the most energy-efficient materials are recycled steel, insulated cement board,
                            structural
                            insulated panels, low-e glazing, vacuum insulation panels.
                            <br /><br />

                            <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Choosing thermal insulation and waterproofing</li>

                            Home insulation is essential when talking about an energy efficient home. When choosing
                            materials for house insulation, criteria such as thermal conductivity (k or λ) and thermal
                            resistance (R-value) are taken into account. Polystyrene and mineral wool are viable
                            options,
                            but you can also go for environmentally friendly options such as polyurethane foam from
                            plant
                            materials, straw bales, even sheep's wool.
                            <br /><br />

                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Designing and choosing the roof</li>
                            Cool roofs are the most widely used in building energy-efficient homes and reduce energy
                            consumption by up to 10%.
                            <br /><br />

                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Designing eaves and shading elements</li>
                            Stretches and other adjacent elements should be designed so that energy losses are
                            minimised.
                            <br /><br />

                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Window design, sizing and selection</li>
                            Windows are where the greatest heat loss occurs so it is preferable to choose 4-season or
                            low-e
                            windows and high quality joinery that does not allow heat loss.

                            <br /><br />
                            <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Choosing an efficient heating/cooling system</li>
                            Heat pumps are among the most economical home heating systems. If heat pump systems cannot
                            be
                            installed, central heating systems, especially condensing ones, or air conditioners in the
                            higher energy classes, can be used.

                            <br /><br />
                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Using natural elements to increase the energy efficiency of
                                your
                                home</li>
                            Tree barriers, shading pergolas are natural and inexpensive solutions to increase the energy
                            efficiency of a building.
                            <br /><br />

                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Humidity control and ventilation</li>
                            Ventilation systems that also have a humidity control function help to save the energy used
                            to
                            heat and cool the home, and therefore contribute greatly to increasing the energy efficiency
                            of
                            the home.

                            <br /><br />
                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Heat recovery ventilation</li>
                            The heat recovery ventilation system is one of the most economical. The principle of
                            operation
                            is very simple: warm air is extracted from the house and its heat is transferred to the cold
                            air
                            taken in from outside, heating it. The system can also be used in summer to cool the house.
                            <br /><br />

                            <li style="font-size: 18px;"> Using alternative energy sources</li>
                            A home powered by solar energy through photovoltaic panels is certainly one of the most
                            economical in the long run, as is the use of electricity produced by wind power systems.
                            Another
                            option, which is also used in Romania, in Beiuș for example, is geothermal water heating.

                        <h3>Increasing the energy efficiency of a house</h3>
                        <br />
                        If the building is already constructed and the house cannot be designed from the outset to
                        consume
                        as little energy as possible, we can turn to subsequent solutions. Those interested can access
                        funds
                        through the Green House programme, which aims to make homes more efficient. Through this
                        programme,
                        funds can be accessed for insulating the home as well as installing systems that provide
                        electricity
                        from renewable sources.
                        <br />

                        We can reduce the energy consumption of an existing house or apartment by:
                        <ol class="s">
                            <li>Insulating inside walls - with polystyrene, mineral wool or environmentally friendly
                                materials such as straw bales </li>
                            <li>Insulating the outside of walls</li>
                            <li>Changing the windows - because most heat is lost through windows, changing them can
                                greatly
                                improve thermal comfort in the home</li>
                            <li>Insulating the roof, loft or terrace</li>
                            <li>Basement insulation </li>
                            <li>Making the heating/cooling system more efficient</li>
                            <li>Energy efficiency - using energy saving light bulbs, energy savers, energy saving
                                equipment,
                                new energy efficient appliances</li>
                            <li>Heating efficiency of domestic water heating or reducing energy consumption</li>
                            <li>Using intelligent systems to monitor temperature, humidity and other comfort factors -
                                thermostats, for example, are a great help in saving energy
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        Energy efficient buildings are the future for our homes and beyond. Investing in energy-saving
                        solutions will also save money and take care of the environment.
