                                        An energy-efficient home is one that uses as little energy as possible for lighting,
                                        heating and
                                        cooling. In recent years, building green homes has become an important concern for
                                        builders and
                                        developers from both environmental and economic perspectives.
                                        <br />
                                        All over the world, people have become increasingly interested in low energy housing,
                                        which is
                                        approaching zero energy consumption. There is already a European directive on this
                                        subject,
                                        which will be enforced on the last day of 2020.This directive concerns the construction
                                        of
                                        passive houses, which provide thermal comfort with low energy consumption.
                                        <br />
                                        Passive houses have the highest energy efficiency standard in the world and aim to keep
                                        total
                                        heat, hot water and electricity consumption below 42 kWh/m² per year. Of course, a
                                        passive house
                                        with this level of consumption per year is a tough target to reach, but that doesn't
                                        mean we
                                        can't make our homes more efficient gradually each year until we reach the target.
                                        <br />
                                        Energy efficiency is not just about insulating your home, but also about having a
                                        heating system
                                        that relies on renewable energy, and a ventilation system that extracts and filters
                                        stale air
                                        without losing heat in the process.

                                            Recycling materials is extremely important for the protection of the environment. That
                                            is why the correct collection of products for recycling should be a basic rule for every
                                            company and for each of us. Unfortunately, many people do not know which materials can
                                            be recycled or do not follow the guidelines for the correct collection of packaging that
                                            will end up at specialised centres.
                                            <BR />
                                            In this article we present the information you need to know about proper recycling, both
                                            on the collection of packaging and on which materials can be recycled and which will not
                                            be accepted.
                                            <BR />
                                            So, depending on the material, some items can be recycled more than once - some recycle
                                            very easily and some not at all. On the other hand, some types of materials are not
                                            generally recycled because this activity cannot be economically supported. Cleaning
                                            packaging before disposal (at least by rinsing with water) is a must!

                                An energy-efficient home is one that uses as little energy as possible for lighting,
                                heating and
                                cooling. In recent years, building green homes has become an important concern for
                                builders and
                                developers from both environmental and economic perspectives.
                                <br />
                                All over the world, people have become increasingly interested in low energy housing,
                                which is
                                approaching zero energy consumption. There is already a European directive on this
                                subject,
                                which will be enforced on the last day of 2020.This directive concerns the construction
                                of
                                passive houses, which provide thermal comfort with low energy consumption.
                                <br />
                                Passive houses have the highest energy efficiency standard in the world and aim to keep
                                total
                                heat, hot water and electricity consumption below 42 kWh/m² per year. Of course, a
                                passive house
                                with this level of consumption per year is a tough target to reach, but that doesn't
                                mean we
                                can't make our homes more efficient gradually each year until we reach the target.
                                <br />
                                Energy efficiency is not just about insulating your home, but also about having a
                                heating system
                                that relies on renewable energy, and a ventilation system that extracts and filters
                                stale air
                                without losing heat in the process.

                                Recycling materials is extremely important for the protection of the environment. That
                                is why the correct collection of products for recycling should be a basic rule for every
                                company and for each of us. Unfortunately, many people do not know which materials can
                                be recycled or do not follow the guidelines for the correct collection of packaging that
                                will end up at specialised centres.
                                <BR />
                                In this article we present the information you need to know about proper recycling, both
                                on the collection of packaging and on which materials can be recycled and which will not
                                be accepted.
                                <BR />
                                So, depending on the material, some items can be recycled more than once - some recycle
                                very easily and some not at all. On the other hand, some types of materials are not
                                generally recycled because this activity cannot be economically supported. Cleaning
                                packaging before disposal (at least by rinsing with water) is a must!
