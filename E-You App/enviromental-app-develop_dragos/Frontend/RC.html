                                Recycling materials is extremely important for the protection of the environment. That
                                is why the correct collection of products for recycling should be a basic rule for every
                                company and for each of us. Unfortunately, many people do not know which materials can
                                be recycled or do not follow the guidelines for the correct collection of packaging that
                                will end up at specialised centres.
                                <BR />
                                In this article we present the information you need to know about proper recycling, both
                                on the collection of packaging and on which materials can be recycled and which will not
                                be accepted.

                                So, depending on the material, some items can be recycled more than once - some recycle
                                very easily and some not at all. On the other hand, some types of materials are not
                                generally recycled because this activity cannot be economically supported. Cleaning
                                packaging before disposal (at least by rinsing with water) is a must!
                                <BR />

                                <BR />

                                The metal must be clean in order to be accepted in the selective recycling centres.
                                That's why aluminium containers should be washed with water and then pressed to take up
                                as little space as possible.

                    <BR />
                    Also, some metal items may come from electronics or household appliances. However, you should be
                    aware that for the full recycling of household appliances and electronics, products should be taken
                    to specialised centres, as they are not accepted at every recycling centre.
                    <BR />
                    The collection process for recycling products is therefore simple, if the rules are known and
                    followed. However, if the materials arriving at the recycling centre are dirty or do not comply with
                    these recommendations, they will not be accepted.</p>
